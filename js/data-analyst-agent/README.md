# Data Analyst Agent for Microsoft Teams

This sample demonstrates how to build an AI-powered data analyst agent that can be integrated into Microsoft Teams. It helps users explore and visualize data through natural language conversations and Adaptive Cards charts.

## Features
- 🔍Query databases using natural language
- 📊 Generate visualizations using [Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.microsoft.com/?topic=welcome) from query results
- 📈 Analyze data patterns and trends
- 🔄 `"/reset"` command to clear the conversation history.

## Running the Sample

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18.x or higher
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Teams Toolkit Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) for Visual Studio Code
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A Microsoft Teams account with the ability to upload custom apps
- OpenAI API Key or Azure OpenAI resource.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/teams-agent-accelerator-samples
   cd js/data-analyst-agent
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Environment Setup
1. Copy the sample environment file:
   ```bash
   cp sample.env .env
   ```

2. Update the `.env` file with your configuration:
   - `BOT_ID`: Your Microsoft Teams bot ID (will be automatically generated if using Teams Toolkit)
   - `BOT_PASSWORD`: Your bot's password (will be automatically generated if using Teams Toolkit)
   - Azure OpenAI or OpenAI configurations. See `sample.env` for more details.

### Running the Bot

#### Option 1: Local deployment using Teams Toolkit (Recommended)
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code
2. Press F5 to start the debug session (Debug Edge)
3. Teams Toolkit will handle:
   - Starting the local bot server
   - Tunneling for external access
   - Opening Teams with your bot loaded


#### Option 2: Deploy to Azure using Teams Toolkit
1. Create an empty `.env.dev` file and place it in the `env` folder.
2. Create a `.env.dev.user` file in the `env` folder and add the following contents to it:

```
SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<api key>
SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_BASE=<api base> // Example: https://<id>-eastus2.openai.azure.com/
SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=<api version> // Example: 2024-08-01-preview
```

3. Navigate over to the Teams Toolkit Extension in VSCode, and login to your Azure & M365 credentials.
4. Then select "Provision" under the "Lifecycle" tab. Follow the instructions to select a resource group, and then click "Provision".
5. Once the resources have been provisioned successfully, select "Deploy". It can take 5-10 minutes to deploy your app.
6. Once the app has been deployed successfully, sideload `appPackage.dev.zip` file into Teams following the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-upload).

## Appendix

### Dataset
This agent uses the AdventureWorks sample database, a Microsoft-provided dataset that simulates a bicycle manufacturer's data. The database includes:

#### Core Business Areas
- **Sales**: Orders, customers, territories
- **Production**: Products, inventory, work orders
- **Purchasing**: Vendors, purchase orders
- **HR**: Employees, departments
- **Person**: Contact information

#### Sample Questions
You can ask the agent questions like:
- "Show me the top-selling products this year"
- "What's the sales trend by territory?"

See the [AdventureWorks README](src/data/README.md) for more details.

### Architecture
![Data Analyst Agent Architecture](assets/architecture-diagram.png)

**Core Components**
  - __Data Analyst Agent__: Main orchestrator that handles user requests
  - __SQL Expert Agent__: Handles database querying
  - __AC Expert Agent__: Creates data visualizations using Adaptive Cards
  - __Base Agent__: Handles LLM calls and orchestration. Other agents are built on top of this.
